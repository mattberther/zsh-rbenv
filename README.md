# zsh-rbenv

> zsh plugin for installing, updating and loading `rbenv`  
> Inspired by [zsh-nvm](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm)

## Usage

Once the plugin's installed rbenv will be available. You'll probably want to load this as one of your first plugins 
so ruby/gem is available for any other plugins that may require them.

zsh-rbenv also wraps nvm in some additional functionality.

### Upgrade
If you want to upgrade to the latest rbenv :

`$ rbenv upgrade`


## Installation

### Using [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Bundle `zsh-rbenv` in your `.zshrc`

```shell
antigen bundle mattberther/zsh-rbenv
```

### Using [zplug](https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug)
